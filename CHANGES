Changes with APR-util b1  

  *) The apr_bucket_shared and apr_bucket_simple structures have been
     removed as an API simplification/optimization.  This should be
     transparent outside APR-util except to callers who attempt to
     directly manipulate the buckets' internal structure (which is
     not recommended anyway) and to callers who create their own
     bucket types. [Cliff Woolley]

  *) apr_bucket_simple_split() and apr_bucket_simple_copy() are now
     exported functions, which could be helpful in implementing
     external bucket types. [Cliff Woolley]

  *) The third parameter to apr_bucket_shared_make() is now
     'apr_off_t length' rather than 'apr_off_t end', since the
     end usually had to be computed by the caller and all we
     really want is the length anyway. [Cliff Woolley]
