Changes with APR-util b1  

  *) We have to initialize the heap buckets to the correct length.
     we were seeing heap buckets with 17 chars in them reporting
     a length of 9017, because they were initialized to the amount
     of memory allocated, instead of the amount of memory used.
     This was only an issue for heap buckets created by the
     apr_brigade_* functions.   [Ryan Bloom]

  *) apr_bucket_init_types() and apr_bucket_insert_type() have been
     removed... they're not needed anymore. [Cliff Woolley]

  *) The apr_bucket_shared and apr_bucket_simple structures have been
     removed as an API simplification/optimization.  This should be
     transparent outside APR-util except to callers who attempt to
     directly manipulate the buckets' internal structure (which is
     not recommended anyway) and to callers who create their own
     bucket types. [Cliff Woolley]

  *) apr_bucket_simple_split() and apr_bucket_simple_copy() are now
     exported functions, which could be helpful in implementing
     external bucket types. [Cliff Woolley]

  *) The third parameter to apr_bucket_shared_make() is now
     'apr_off_t length' rather than 'apr_off_t end', since the
     end usually had to be computed by the caller and all we
     really want is the length anyway. [Cliff Woolley]
