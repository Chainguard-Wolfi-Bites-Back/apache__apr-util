Release:
    ...on the 12th as part of Apache 2.0a9  [need specifics here]


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * release distros do not include a "test" dir. don't put it in the
      top-level SUBDIRS list, but definitely get it cleaned for the
      dev guys.  (Greg volunteers)

    * we distribute 2 (3?) copies of sdbm in apr, and these are -public-?
      get organized.

RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * fix apr_dbm_geterror() prototype
      Status: OtherBill +1, Greg +1


Other bugs that need fixing:

    * revise the included SDBM package to use the apr_ prefix on the
      function/typedef names.
      Status: Greg +1


Other features that need writing:

    * populate src/uri and src/xml from Apache

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values
