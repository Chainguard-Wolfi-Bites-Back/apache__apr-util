APRUTIL LIBRARY STATUS:						-*-text-*-
Last modified at [$Date: 2000/12/18 03:52:16 $]

Release:
    ...on the 12th as part of Apache 2.0a9  [need specifics here]


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Source code layout needs to be decided for apr and apr-util.  There
      has been some discussion about adding a src/ directory to apr or removing
      it from apr-util/.  Either way, this needs to be decided.

    * release distros do not include a "test" dir. don't put it in the
      top-level SUBDIRS list, but definitely get it cleaned for the
      dev guys.  (Greg volunteers)


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * fix apr_dbm_geterror() prototype
      Status: OtherBill +1, Greg +1


Other bugs that need fixing:

    * revise the included SDBM package to use the apr_ prefix on the
      function/typedef names.
      Status: Greg +1


Other features that need writing:

    * populate src/uri and src/xml from Apache

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values


Available Patches:


Open Issues:

    * Prefix for the code.
      Status:
        APR: Ryan +1, Greg +1

    * Compatibility header to deal with renamed symbols.
      NOTE:
	OtherBill suggests that Apache, APR, and APR-utils all have
	compat headers, and Apache's includes APR-util's which includes
	APR's.  OtherBill would like apache-2.0/src/include/ap_compat.h to
        include apr-util/include/apu_compat.h, which itself includes
        apr/include/apr_compat.h.  If the user employs apr_compat, and
        only uses features moved to apr, they only need the apr package.
      Status:
        apr-util/include/: Ryan +1, Greg +0, OtherBill +1
	apache-2.0/src/include/: Greg +1, Ryan -0.5, OtherBill -0.5
