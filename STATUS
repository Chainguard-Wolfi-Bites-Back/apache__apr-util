Last modified at [$Date: 2001/01/13 13:28:00 $]

Release:
    ...on the 12th as part of Apache 2.0a9  [need specifics here]


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Prefix for the code.  This vote ends on Wednesday!
      Bill notes - recent problems on win32 would have been averted if the
      author noticed their names didn't match their linkage declarations.
      Status:
        APR: Ryan +1, Greg +1, David +1, Jim +1
        apu: wrowe +1

    * Many linkage errors are gpfaulting Apache/win32 in various configs
      (load mod_dav, for example.)  Must complete the APR_DECLARES
        Gregory Nicholes is working on this, with quick response from rbb
        Will Rowe will fold over the libapr.dsp into it's own library
        and remove the exports from the simple apr.dsp once it's done.

    * Source code layout needs to be decided for apr and apr-util.  There
      has been some discussion about adding a src/ directory to apr or removing
      it from apr-util/.  Either way, this needs to be decided.
      Status: See vote in apr/STATUS

    * release distros do not include a "test" dir. don't put it in the
      top-level SUBDIRS list, but definitely get it cleaned for the
      dev guys.  (Greg volunteers)


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * fix apr_dbm_geterror() prototype
      Status: OtherBill +1, Greg +1


Other bugs that need fixing:

    * revise the included SDBM package to use the apr_ prefix on the
      function/typedef names.
      Status: Greg +1


Other features that need writing:

    * populate src/uri and src/xml from Apache

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values


Available Patches:


Open Issues:

    * Compatibility header to deal with renamed symbols.
      NOTE:
	OtherBill suggests that Apache, APR, and APR-utils all have
	compat headers, and Apache's includes APR-util's which includes
	APR's.  OtherBill would like apache-2.0/src/include/ap_compat.h to
        include apr-util/include/apu_compat.h, which itself includes
        apr/include/apr_compat.h.  If the user employs apr_compat, and
        only uses features moved to apr, they only need the apr package.
      Status:
        apr-util/include/: Ryan +1, Greg +0, OtherBill +1, David +1
	apache-2.0/src/include/: Greg +1, Ryan -0.5, OtherBill -0.5
