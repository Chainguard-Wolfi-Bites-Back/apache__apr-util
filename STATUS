Release:
    ...on the 12th as part of Apache 2.0a9  [need specifics here]


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * revise the included SDBM package to use the apr_ prefix (on the
      header and on the function/typedef names.
      Status: Greg +0, Ryan +1(?), OtherBill +1

    * Pick up APRVARS from APR (for building the test progs). Export
      some library variables from APRUTIL (e.g. -lgdbm) for clients to
      use. (Greg volunteers)


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:

    * fix apr_dbm_geterror() prototype
      Status: OtherBill +1, Greg +1

    * auto-rebuild aprutil.exports (and apr.exports) during the
      make/build process.
      Status: Ryan +1, Greg +1

    * move apu_private.h to include/private/
      Status: Ryan +1, OtherBill +1, Greg +0

    * turn ap_bucket_split_any() into ap_brigade_split().
      Message-ID: ???

      Note: awaiting code from Cliff Wooley for this


Other bugs that need fixing:


Other features that need writing:

    * populate src/uri and src/xml from Apache

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values

    * Compatibility header to deal with renamed symbols.
      NOTE:
	OtherBill suggests that Apache, APR, and APR-utils all have
	compat headers, and Apache's includes APR-util's which includes
	APR's.
      Status:
        apr-util/include/: Ryan +1, Greg +0, OtherBill +1
	apache-2.0/src/include/: Greg +1, Ryan -0.5, OtherBill -0.5
