Release:
    2.0a9   : released December 12, 2000


RELEASE SHOWSTOPPERS:

    * Need apu_compat.h to track the latest renames
      [Will voulenteers - is on it]

    * add misc/version.c and related machinery once the pattern is
      layed out in APR.


RELEASE NON-SHOWSTOPPERS BUT WOULD BE REAL NICE TO WRAP THESE UP:


Other bugs that need fixing:

    * revise the included SDBM package to use the apr_ prefix on the
      function/typedef names.
      Status: Greg +1


Other features that need writing:

    * write apr_brigade_(p)getline, per the hackathon

    * populate src/uri from Apache

    * possibly move test/testdbm* to util/dbu
      Status: Greg +1 (volunteers)


Documentation that needs writing:

    * API documentation
        Status:

    * doc the lifetimes of apr_dbm return values
